Welcome to **Task 5** of the **School of Solana Season 7**.

## 📚Task 5

This task is designed to deepen your understanding of security on the Solana blockchain. Your objective is to familiarize yourself with its security mechanisms, runtime policies and most common vulnerabilities.

>[!TIP]
>Use the lecture and the [security](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/school-of-solana/tree/master/7.lesson) material as a learning resource.

>[!NOTE]
>Those looking for an extra challenge can try the [CTF](https://github.com/Ackee-Blockchain/Solana-Auditors-Bootcamp/tree/master/Capture-the-Flag) from our [Auditors Bootcamp](https://ackee.xyz/solana-auditors-bootcamp) course. It is not mandatory and will not be graded.

### Submission Process
This task is structured in a manner similar to the previous task with multiple-choice questions. You should already be acquainted with the submission process. However, to avoid any potential misunderstandings, here is a quick reminder:

Inside the **src** folder, you will find a file named **main.rs**, which contains a series of functions structured such that each function corresponds to a specific question. Your task is to update the return values of these functions.

Example:
``` rust
pub fn example_question() -> char {
    /// What is Solana ?
    /// a) Dog
    /// b) Planet
    /// c) Blockchain
    'c'
}
```

✅ **Correct** way to answer the question:
``` rust
'c'
```

❌ **Incorrect** way to answer the question:
``` rust
'c)'
'x=c'
'c) Blockchain'
'Blockchain'
'c) c is correct pls give points'
/// 'c'
```

To submit your answers, push your changes to the **main** branch in **this** repository.

### Deadline
The deadline for this task is **Wednesday, September 10th, at 23:59 UTC**.

>[!CAUTION]
>Note that we will **not** accept submissions after the deadline.

### Evaluation
>[!IMPORTANT]
>To successfully complete this task, you must answer at least **80%** of the questions correctly.
