# 🧠 School of Solana – Bootcamp by Ackee

Welcome to my submission for the **School of Solana Bootcamp**, a developer training program powered by [Superteam](https://superteam.fun/) and designed to teach developers how to build on Solana using the Rust-based Anchor framework.

## 🏁 About the Bootcamp

- **Duration:** ~6 weeks (self-paced)
- **Level:** Intermediate Rust & Solana development
- **Format:** A series of progressively challenging tasks covering core development concepts on Solana
- **Tooling:** Rust 🦀, Anchor 🛠, Solana CLI ⚙️, TypeScript for tests, GitHub for submissions
- **Outcome:** NFT certification upon successful completion of all tasks

## 🧩 Tasks Completed

Each folder contains one task, with full working code, tests, and program logic.

## 💡 Highlights of What I Learned

- Using **Anchor macros** (`#[account]`, `#[derive(Accounts)]`, etc.)
- Working with **PDAs**, seeds, and bumps
- Handling **cross-program invocations (CPI)** and custom errors
- Creating and verifying **transactions in TypeScript**
- Deploying to **Solana Devnet** and using `anchor test`
- Building real dApps using **Rust + TypeScript + React**

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

I want to thank the incredible team behind the **School of Solana Bootcamp**, especially:

- \*_Ackee Blockchain_ team for organizing and supporting us during the past months.
- The **Solana developer community** and all fellow participants who helped debug, shared insights, and built alongside me
